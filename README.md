# Team Ephesus - Hospital Data Management

This repository contains scripts to manage and load hospital data into a PostgreSQL database. The project involves three main tables: `HospitalQualityDetails`, `HospitalSpecificDetails`, and `HospitalLogistics`. 

## Scripts Overview

There are three main scripts in this repository:

### 1. `create_tables.py`
This script creates the following three tables:

- **HospitalQualityDetails**  
  Stores hospital quality-related data.
  
- **HospitalSpecificDetails**  
  Contains detailed information about each hospital (address, name, etc.).
  
- **HospitalLogistics**  
  Includes logistics data for hospitals such as bed occupancy, ICU usage, and COVID-related stats.

This can be run like this:
```python
python create_tables.py
```

#### Table Schemas:

  - **HospitalQualityDetails**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS HospitalQualityDetails (
    hospital_pk TEXT REFERENCES HospitalSpecificDetails(hospital_pk),
    last_updated DATE CHECK (last_updated <= CURRENT_DATE),
    hospital_overall_rating INTEGER,
    hospital_ownership TEXT,
    emergency_services BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY (hospital_pk, last_updated)
  );
```
  - **HospitalSpecificDetails**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS HospitalSpecificDetails (
  hospital_pk TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  state CHAR(2),
  hospital_name TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  city TEXT,
  zip CHAR(5),
  fips_code NUMERIC,
  longitude NUMERIC,
  latitude NUMERIC
);
```
  - **HospitalLogistics**
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS HospitalLogistics (
  hospital_pk TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES HospitalSpecificDetails(hospital_pk),
  collection_week DATE CHECK (collection_week <= CURRENT_DATE::DATE),
  all_adult_hospital_beds_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (all_adult_hospital_beds_7_day_avg >= 0),
  all_pediatric_inpatient_beds_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (all_pediatric_inpatient_beds_7_day_avg >= 0),
  all_adult_hospital_inpatient_bed_occupied_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (all_adult_hospital_inpatient_bed_occupied_7_day_avg >= 0),
  all_pediatric_inpatient_bed_occupied_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (all_pediatric_inpatient_bed_occupied_7_day_avg >= 0),
  total_icu_beds_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (total_icu_beds_7_day_avg >= 0),
  icu_beds_used_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (icu_beds_used_7_day_avg >= 0),
  inpatient_beds_used_covid_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (inpatient_beds_used_covid_7_day_avg >= 0),
  staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_covid_7_day_avg NUMERIC CHECK (staffed_icu_adult_patients_confirmed_covid_7_day_avg >= 0)
  );
```
This script will need to be called first, to ensure that the tables exist for when data is loaded in with the next two scripts.

### 2. `load-hhs.py`
This script loads HHS (Hospital and Health Services) data into the `HospitalLogistics` table. It takes a single argument: the file path to the CSV file containing the HHS data.

This can be run like this:
  ```python
python load-hhs.py 2022-09-23-hhs-data.csv
```

### 3. `load-quality.py`
This script loads Hospital Quality data into the `HospitalQualityDetails` table. It takes two arguments: date for which the quality data is updated and the file path to the CSV file containing the quality data.


This can be run like this:
  ```python
python load-quality.py 2021-07-01 Hospital_General_Information-2021-07
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure that all dependencies are installed.
2. Create a file `credentials.py` with 2 variables: `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` and ensure these are set with your personal database credentials.
3. Run the `create-tables.py` script.
4. Run the `load-hhs.py` and `load-quality.py` scripts.
